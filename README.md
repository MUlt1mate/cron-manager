# PHP Cron tasks manager

This is a flexible tasks manager designed for MVC-type applications. It's used instead of standard linux *crontab* command.

The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to manipulate repetitive tasks.

## How this is works
Replace all tasks in crontab file with one which will invoke method ```TaskRunner::checkAndRunTasks()```.

Import tasks from current crontab file or add them manually. Active tasks will run one by one if current time matches with the task's time expression. Output of tasks can be handled. For each execution will be assigned status:
* **Success** if method returned ```true```; 
* **Error** if method returned ```false``` or an exception was caught; 
* **Started** if task is running or wasn't ended properly.
